### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
I'm a front-end developer with a sharp eye for detail. I always try to stay ahead in every project I handle.
My core expertise lies in React.js, Redux, TypeScript, Next.js, GraphQL, REST API, NodeJS.
I value effective communication. I always make sure I understand what client needs and keep him updated regularly.
